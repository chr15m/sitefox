Create a sitefox server using [shadow-cljs](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html).

To run this example:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Go into `examples/shadow-cljs`.
3. `npm i --no-save`
4. `npm run serve`

This will start the live-reloading shadow-cljs server compiling devserver.js and run it.
Once you see the message that the server is up you can connect at http://localhost:8000/.

You can run `npm run build` to get a compiled `server.js` for deployment to live systems.
